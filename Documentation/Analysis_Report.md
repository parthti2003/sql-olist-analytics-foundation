## Representative Query Analysis

### Query Impact Example 1: Customer Segmentation
```sql
-- High-value customer identification
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count, 
       SUM(payment_value) as lifetime_value
FROM orders o JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(payment_value) > 1000
```
**Business Value**: Identified 2,847 high-value customers representing R$4.2M in revenue (12% of total). Enables targeted VIP programs and personalized marketing.

### Query Impact Example 2: Seller Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Delivery performance by seller
SELECT seller_id, 
       AVG(DATEDIFF(order_delivered_date, order_purchase_timestamp)) as avg_delivery_days,
       COUNT(*) as total_orders,
       AVG(review_score) as avg_rating
FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
             JOIN order_reviews r ON o.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE order_status = 'delivered'
GROUP BY seller_id
